#1. Iterate 0 to 10 using for loop, do the same using while loop.
i = 0
while i < 11:
    print(i)
    i = i + 1 

#2. Iterate 10 to 0 using for loop, do the same using while loop.
a = 10
while a > -1:
    print(a)
    a = a -1

#3. Write a loop that makes seven calls to print(), so we get on the output the following triangle.
for i in range(8):
    print("#"*i)

#4.
